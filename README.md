# DrawPVP
Do you spend your time doodling in class? Do you think you are cyber-worthy? Do you think you are better than your friends? 
If you answered yes, then this is the game for you.

The rules of the game are simple. Be the first among the players on your LAN to have the neural network correctly judge a set of random pre-assigned drawings. 

Clash with your buddies in a competitive game of DrawPVP, doodling to your heart's content.
